## Description:

    AS an upcoming developer, it is of the utmost importance that I have an online presence to show my portfolio, resume and how to connect. I purchased my own website and are currently hosting my website.

## Future:

    I will be migrating all my applications over to my own website for a "one stop shop" for all my items. Currently it is scattered through GH-Pages and Heroku.

## Dependencies:

    Built with React and MaterialUI
